            <h1>How to get a basic site on GitHub: Project Upload</h1>
                    <p>This is the way I figured out, at this point of my learning.</p>
			    <h2>Step 1</h2>
				    <p>Get a GitHub account.
				    If Not, go to <a href="https://github.com/	"> https://github.com</a>	 Use the SantaFe email @my.sfcollege.edu to get a free account. Additionals emails can be added later in settings.<br>
				    On the profile page at https://github.com/your user namepage, click the PLUS  sign at the top right of page, chose: New repository and create it with the name you want.<br>
				    Here it is: project upload, GitHub will fill in the blank, it is now project-upload.<br>
				    Important!<br>
				    Tick the box: Initialize with a README, the descrition will say what this project is about.<br>
				    Clik on the green button: Create repository.</p>
				    <p><img src ="images/newrepository.jpg" alt="New repository"></p>
				<h2>Step 2</h2>
				    <p> Click on the Upload Files button to get our files up there!<br>
				    This will open a drop area.</p>
				    <p><img src ="images/upload.jpg" alt="Upload"></p>
				<h2>Step 3</h2>
				    <p> Drag and drop your files and folders<br>
				    Notice that I drag the index.html file, and the images FOLDER, that way all the images got uploded at once.<br>
				    For now, there is one HTML page: index.html, plus one folder, with two images<br>
				    Add some comments: Add index.html and images folder
				    Click the green commit changes button</p>
				    <p><img src ="images/dragndrop.jpg" alt="Drag and drop"></p>
				<h2>Step 4</h2>    
				    <p>Notice the index.html file, and the images FOLDER, that way all the images got uploded at once.
				    And there is the README, that was created first.<br>
				    For now it is just a colection of files and folder, no site. If all you want is a back of your files, you can stop here. If you want the site to build:<br>
				    Chose Settings, up on the right</p>
				    <p><img src ="images/settings.jpg" alt="Settings"></p>
				<h2>Step 5</h2>
				    <p>Scroll down to GitHub Pages<br>
				    Under Source, click the None drop down menu, select Master Branch, save; Now GitHub will provide the URL for your site:<br>
				    Https:// jacprog.github.io.project-upload/</p>
				    <p>One more thing: See the danger zone at the bottom:<br>
				    There is an option to delete the repository.</p>		
				    <p><img src ="images/publish.jpg" alt="Publish"></p>
				<h2>Step 6</h2>
				    <p>Updates and changes<br>
				    Go back to the main page, find it by going back to the Your profile page, and select the repository.<br>
				    Click Upload files, drag and drop the files and folders that have changes.<br>
				    Click the green commit changes button.<br>
				    Your updates are there to be seen.</p>
				    <p><img src ="images/updates.jpg" alt="Updates"></p> 
				    
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>Your Project is now published from GitHub.<br>
                My next goal is to have all this at the command line Too. Your help is welcome!<br>
